HR Analytics Dashboard
This project is an HR Analytics Dashboard focused on diagnosing a high organizational attrition rate of 16.12% across 1,470 employees.

The analysis uses data visualization to pinpoint critical retention risks. Key findings show disproportionate turnover in the HR and R&D departments, and a significant flight risk within the 25-34 age group. The dashboard also provides insights into job satisfaction and workforce demographics to inform targeted HR strategies.
