HR Analytics Dashboard
This project is an HR Analytics Dashboard focused on diagnosing a high organizational attrition rate of 16.12% across 1,470 employees.

The analysis uses data visualization to pinpoint critical retention risks. Key findings show disproportionate turnover in the HR and R&D departments, and a significant flight risk within the 25-34 age group. The dashboard also provides insights into job satisfaction and workforce demographics to inform targeted HR strategies.

Peoject Inshights

The primary goal of this dashboard is to analyze and mitigate employee attrition (turnover). The data reveals several critical areas of concern:

1. High Attrition Rate
Overall Health: The organization is experiencing a significantly high Attrition Rate of 16.12% (237 employees leaving out of 1,470). This indicates a major organizational problem that requires immediate attention.

2. Departmental and Demographic Focus Areas
Department Hotspot: The HR department has the highest attrition by a large margin, accounting for 56.12% (133 employees) of all departures. This is a severe internal issue, possibly pointing to burnout, poor leadership, or lack of resources within the HR function itself.

Age and Gender Risk:

Gender: Males account for a higher number of departures (150) than females (87).

Age Group: The 25-34 age group is the highest contributor to attrition, making up 29.11% of total turnover. This suggests a failure to retain early-to-mid career professionals.

Education Impact: Attrition is highest among employees with a Life Sciences background (89 departures), followed by Medical (63).

3. Job Satisfaction Issues
Low Satisfaction Concentration: The "Job Satisfaction Rating" table highlights severe dissatisfaction issues, particularly in high-volume roles.

Sales Executive has the highest overall headcount (292) and the highest number of employees rating their satisfaction as 1 (lowest) with 69 people.

Laboratory Technicians also show significant dissatisfaction, with 56 people rating it 1 and 48 rating it 2.

Final Conclusion 
The high 16.12% attrition rate is driven by identifiable and correctable factors rooted in job dissatisfaction and departmental stress.

The immediate priority for the organization must be to launch targeted retention initiatives focused on:

HR Department Crisis: Investigate and address the root causes of the extremely high turnover within the HR Department (the group responsible for retention efforts themselves).

Sales and Lab Roles: Implement immediate interventions to boost job satisfaction for Sales Executives and Laboratory Technicians, who are clearly the most unhappy segments of the workforce.

Key Talent Retention: Develop tailored programs for the 25-34 age group to reduce the loss of critical early-career talent.
